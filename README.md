# CPP P2P FRAMEWORK
CPP peer networking lib or framework (this is an unfinished baseline solution)

Some parts are not currently portable due to absolute paths (will fix asap)

Purpose of this project:
- Serve as a tool that will be used in a bigger project later on
- Explore new methods of learning about computer systems
- revise and improve my computer networks knowledge (from the perspective of socket programming in C++, and investigating kernel code)
- part of another planned project to implement a basic block chain

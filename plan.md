# Plan

## Application
- Discover other hosts of this application
    - Exchange information with them
- Act as a server 


## Main Loop
- Discover hosts
    - Request information from other hosts
        - give my information
        - provide lists of other peers
- Check for connection
    - Serve connections


## Peer Discovery (LAN)
- When the application is first started, it knows no peer hosts
    - peer hosts file may be initialized manually
- periodically, the application will query known peers for lists of peers
